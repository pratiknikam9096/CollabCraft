## 💪 Technical Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Real-time Synchronization Challenge**
**Problem:** Multiple users editing the same file simultaneously could cause conflicts and data loss.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented operational transformation-like approach
- Used Socket.IO for real-time event broadcasting
- Created conflict resolution mechanism with last-write-wins strategy
- Added debouncing to reduce excessive network calls

**Code Example:**
```typescript
const onCodeChange = (code: string, view: ViewUpdate) => {
    const cursorPosition = view.state?.selection?.main?.head
    socket.emit(SocketEvent.TYPING_START, { cursorPosition })
    socket.emit(SocketEvent.FILE_UPDATED, {
        fileId: activeFile.id,
        newContent: code,
    })
    // Debounce typing pause event
    clearTimeout(timeOut)
    const newTimeOut = setTimeout(
        () => socket.emit(SocketEvent.TYPING_PAUSE),
        1000,
    )
}
```

### 2. **State Management Complexity**
**Problem:** Managing complex state across multiple contexts (files, users, chat, settings) became challenging.

**Solution:**
- Implemented Context API with custom hooks
- Created separate contexts for different features
- Used reducer pattern for complex state updates
- Implemented proper cleanup and memory management

### 3. **File System Operations**
**Problem:** Browser security restrictions limit file system access.

**Solution:**
- Used File System Access API for modern browsers
- Implemented fallback using input[type="file"] with webkitdirectory
- Created virtual file system in memory
- Added ZIP export/import functionality

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
**Problem:** Large files and frequent updates caused performance issues.

**Solution:**
- Implemented file size limits (1MB per file)
- Added lazy loading for file contents
- Used React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- Debounced real-time updates

### 5. **Cross-browser Compatibility**
**Problem:** Different browsers have varying support for modern APIs.

**Solution:**
- Feature detection before using modern APIs
- Graceful fallbacks for unsupported features
- Polyfills for missing functionality
- Comprehensive browser testing

## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: "Walk me through the architecture of your collaborative editor."

**Answer:** "The architecture follows a client-server model with real-time communication. On the frontend, I used React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. The state is managed through Context API with multiple contexts for different features like file management, user management, and chat.

The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using Socket.IO for WebSocket communication. When a user makes changes, the client emits events to the server, which broadcasts them to all other connected clients in the same room. This ensures real-time synchronization across all users.

For the code editor, I integrated CodeMirror 6, which provides advanced features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and extensibility. The file system is virtualized in memory with options to import/export projects."

### Q2: "How did you handle real-time synchronization between multiple users?"

**Answer:** "Real-time synchronization was one of the biggest challenges. I implemented an event-driven architecture using Socket.IO. Here's how it works:

1. **Event Broadcasting:** When a user types, the client emits a FILE_UPDATED event with the file ID and new content
2. **Server Relay:** The server receives this event and broadcasts it to all other users in the same room
3. **Client Updates:** Other clients receive the update and apply it to their local state
4. **Conflict Resolution:** I used a last-write-wins approach with timestamps
5. **Debouncing:** To prevent excessive network calls, I debounced the typing events

I also implemented cursor tracking, so users can see where others are typing in real-time, similar to Google Docs."

### Q3: "What challenges did you face with state management?"

**Answer:** "State management became complex because I had multiple interconnected features - file system, user presence, chat messages, editor settings, and real-time updates. 

I solved this by:
1. **Separation of Concerns:** Created separate contexts for different features (FileContext, ChatContext, UserContext, etc.)
2. **Custom Hooks:** Built reusable hooks like useFileSystem, useChatRoom for clean API
3. **Event Cleanup:** Properly managed Socket.IO event listeners to prevent memory leaks
4. **Optimistic Updates:** Updated UI immediately for better UX, then synced with server

The key was keeping contexts focused on single responsibilities while allowing them to communicate when necessary."

### Q4: "How did you implement the code execution feature?"

**Answer:** "For code execution, I integrated with the Piston API, which provides a sandboxed environment for running code in 40+ languages. Here's the flow:

1. **Language Detection:** Automatically detect language from file extension using lang-map library
2. **API Integration:** Send code, language, and input to Piston API
3. **Result Handling:** Display stdout for successful execution or stderr for errors
4. **Security:** All code runs in Piston's secure sandbox, not on our servers

I also added features like input handling for interactive programs and proper error display. The execution results are shown in a dedicated panel with syntax highlighting for better readability."

### Q5: "How did you ensure good performance with multiple users?"

**Answer:** "Performance optimization was crucial for a good user experience:

1. **Debouncing:** Limited real-time updates to prevent network spam
2. **File Size Limits:** Restricted files to 1MB to prevent memory issues
3. **Lazy Loading:** Only load file contents when actually opened
4. **React Optimization:** Used React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback strategically
5. **Efficient Re-renders:** Structured state to minimize unnecessary component updates
6. **Connection Management:** Proper cleanup of Socket.IO connections

I also implemented loading states and error boundaries to handle edge cases gracefully."

### Q6: "What would you improve if you had more time?"

**Answer:** "Several areas I'd enhance:

1. **Operational Transformation:** Implement proper OT algorithm for better conflict resolution
2. **Persistent Storage:** Add database integration for saving projects
3. **User Authentication:** Implement proper user accounts and permissions
4. **Version Control:** Add Git-like versioning and branching
5. **Performance:** Implement virtual scrolling for large files
6. **Mobile Experience:** Better responsive design for mobile devices
7. **Testing:** Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
8. **Deployment:** Set up CI/CD pipeline with Docker containers

The current version is a solid MVP, but these improvements would make it production-ready."

### Q7: "How did you handle error scenarios and edge cases?"

**Answer:** "Error handling was implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Network Errors:** Graceful handling of connection drops with reconnection logic
2. **File Operations:** Validation for file names, size limits, and permission checks
3. **User Input:** Sanitization and validation of all user inputs
4. **API Failures:** Fallback mechanisms when external APIs are unavailable
5. **Browser Compatibility:** Feature detection and polyfills
6. **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of event listeners and timeouts

I used React Error Boundaries to catch and display user-friendly error messages, and implemented comprehensive logging for debugging."
