# Video Call and Data Syncing Fixes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve the following issues:

1. **"Syncing data, please wait..." loading indefinitely**
2. **New users showing under "people" when someone refreshes**
3. **Video calls not persisting on page refresh**
4. **Cookie handling and session persistence**

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Infinite Syncing Message
**Problem**: The "Syncing data, please wait..." toast would show indefinitely when users joined a room.

**Solution**: 
- Added a `syncing-complete` event from the server
- Server sends this event after 1 second when there are multiple users
- Client dismisses the syncing toast and shows "Data sync completed!" message
- Uses `useRef` to track the toast ID for proper dismissal

### 2. User State Management on Refresh
**Problem**: When users refreshed their pages, they would appear as new users to others.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced user state management in the server
- Users are now properly tracked by username + roomId combination
- When reconnecting, existing users are updated instead of creating duplicates
- Added `getUserByUsername()` helper function for better user lookup
- Users maintain their status (online/offline) across reconnections

### 3. Video Call Persistence
**Problem**: Video calls would end when users refreshed their pages.

**Solution**:
- Added video call state tracking on the server
- Client stores video call state in localStorage
- Auto-restore video calls on page refresh (within 5 minutes)
- Server maintains active video call sessions
- Users can rejoin ongoing calls automatically

### 4. Cookie and Session Management
**Problem**: Cookies weren't being used effectively for session persistence.

**Solution**:
- Extended cookie expiration to 24 hours
- Improved cookie parsing and fallback logic
- Better reconnection handling with stored credentials
- Enhanced socket authentication with room data

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side Changes (`server/src/server.ts`)

#### Enhanced User Management
```typescript
// Track users by username + roomId instead of just socketId
function getUserByUsername(username: string, roomId: string): User | null {
  return userSocketMap.find((user) => user.username === username && user.roomId === roomId) || null
}
```

#### Video Call State Tracking
```typescript
let activeVideoCalls: Map<string, {
  roomId: string,
  participants: string[],
  startedBy: string,
  startTime: number
}> = new Map()
```

#### Improved Reconnection Logic
```typescript
socket.on("reconnect_attempt", ({ roomId, username }) => {
  // Update existing user instead of creating new one
  // Restore video call state
  // Send current room state
})
```

#### New Socket Events
- `syncing-complete`: Notifies client when data sync is complete
- `video-call-status`: Sends current video call state to reconnecting users
- Enhanced `USER_ONLINE` event with username information

### Client-Side Changes

#### Socket Context (`client/src/context/SocketContext.tsx`)
- Added `syncing-complete` event handler
- Added `video-call-status` event handler  
- Added `USER_ONLINE` event handler
- Improved reconnection settings (5 attempts, better delays)
- Toast management with refs for proper dismissal

#### Video Call Context (`client/src/context/VideoCallContext.tsx`)
- Video call state persistence in localStorage
- Auto-restore video calls on page refresh
- Enhanced reconnection logic for video calls
- Better state management for participants

## New Features

### 1. Automatic Video Call Restoration
- Video calls are automatically restored when users refresh their pages
- Only works for calls started within the last 5 minutes
- Users can seamlessly rejoin ongoing calls

### 2. Enhanced User Status Tracking
- Users show as "online" or "offline" instead of disappearing
- Better handling of temporary disconnections
- Users can see when others come back online

### 3. Improved Data Syncing
- Clear feedback when data sync is complete
- No more infinite loading messages
- Better user experience during room joining

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Data Syncing
1. Join a room with multiple users
2. Verify "Syncing data, please wait..." appears
3. Verify it changes to "Data sync completed!" after 1 second

### 2. Test User Refresh
1. Have multiple users in a room
2. Refresh one user's page
3. Verify they don't appear as a new user
4. Verify they maintain their previous state

### 3. Test Video Call Persistence
1. Start a video call with multiple users
2. Refresh one user's page
3. Verify they can rejoin the call automatically
4. Verify the call continues for other participants

### 4. Test Cookie Persistence
1. Join a room
2. Close the browser completely
3. Reopen and navigate to the same room
4. Verify automatic reconnection

## Configuration

### Cookie Settings
- **Expiration**: 24 hours
- **HttpOnly**: true (for security)
- **Secure**: true in production, false in development
- **SameSite**: "none" in production, "lax" in development

### Socket.IO Settings
- **Reconnection Attempts**: 5
- **Reconnection Delay**: 1-5 seconds (exponential backoff)
- **Timeout**: 20 seconds
- **Auth**: Includes stored room data

## Error Handling

### Graceful Fallbacks
- If cookies are missing, fallback to localStorage
- If video call restoration fails, clear stale state
- If reconnection fails, show appropriate error messages

### State Cleanup
- Automatic cleanup of stale video call data
- Proper cleanup of peer connections on disconnect
- Memory leak prevention with proper event cleanup

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Features
- **localStorage**: For persistent state storage
- **MediaDevices API**: For camera/microphone access
- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer video calls
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication

### Fallbacks
- Graceful degradation when features aren't available
- Clear error messages for unsupported browsers
- Alternative connection methods when WebRTC fails

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of video streams and peer connections
- Efficient user state tracking
- Minimal localStorage usage

### Network Optimization
- Efficient reconnection logic
- Minimal data transfer during reconnection
- Smart state synchronization

## Security Features

### Cookie Security
- HttpOnly cookies prevent XSS attacks
- Secure cookies in production
- Proper SameSite settings

### User Validation
- Username uniqueness per room
- Room ID validation
- Socket authentication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Video call not restoring**
   - Check browser permissions for camera/microphone
   - Verify localStorage is available
   - Check console for error messages

2. **Users still appearing as new**
   - Verify cookies are being set correctly
   - Check server logs for connection issues
   - Ensure proper room ID matching

3. **Syncing message still infinite**
   - Check server `syncing-complete` event
   - Verify client event handlers are registered
   - Check for JavaScript errors

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
DEBUG=socket.io:* npm run dev
```

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
- Video call recording functionality
- Screen sharing improvements
- Better connection quality monitoring
- Advanced user presence indicators

### Scalability
- Redis for session storage in production
- Load balancing for multiple server instances
- Database persistence for long-term state

## Conclusion

These fixes provide a robust foundation for:
- Reliable user session management
- Persistent video call experiences
- Smooth reconnection handling
- Better user experience during data synchronization

The implementation follows best practices for real-time applications and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
